# Web-based Inference and Human proteome-wide pKas

We provide a browser-based KaML interface for both on-demand
predictions and interactive exploration of a precomputed human
proteome atlas:

    Home:      https://kaml.computchem.org
    Atlas:     https://kaml.computchem.org/human

The web tools run the same KaML models described in the manuscript and
use ESM-2 (`esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`) and/or ESM-C (`esmc-6b-2024-12`) via 
the EvolutionaryScale Forge API for protein embeddings where on-demand 
inference is required.

------------------------------------------------------------
Web-based inference: https://kaml.computchem.org
------------------------------------------------------------

The web-base interface provides a simple front end to the KaML inference
pipeline for user-supplied sequences.

Requirements for KaML-ESM2:
- A modern web browser.

Requirements for KaML-ESMC:
- An active ESM Forge API token issued by EvolutionaryScale.

The KaML web interface does not issue ESM Forge tokens. Each user must
obtain and manage their own token directly from EvolutionaryScale.

Obtaining an ESM Forge API token:

1. Visit the EvolutionaryScale Forge site:

       https://forge.evolutionaryscale.ai

2. Sign up or sign in with your account.
3. In the leftmost menu, under the API header select 'API Keys'
4. In the textbox with the 'API Key Name' placehold text, name your key, e.g. esm
5. Create a new Forge API token and copy the token string.

Treat this token as a secret (similar to a password); do not publish
or commit it.

Using the token in the KaML web interface:

1. Open:

       https://kaml.computchem.org

2. Select ESMC for either channel, i.e. Acidic or Basic.
2. Enter your protein sequence, UniProtID, or PDBID-CHAINID into the input box.
3. Paste your ESM Forge API token into the token field.
4. Submit to run predictions.

The Forge token is used only to obtain ESM-C embeddings for your
sequences via the Forge API; KaML then applies the pre-trained KaML-ESMC
heads to produce residue-level predictions.

Please follow EvolutionaryScale’s terms of use and your institution’s
policies when requesting, storing, and using Forge API tokens.

------------------------------------------------------------
Precomputed human proteome-wide atlas: kaml.computchem.org/human
------------------------------------------------------------

The `/human` view provides interactive access to a precomputed
KaML “human atlas” of predictions across the human proteome.

Key points:

- Predictions in this atlas were precomputed using the KaML-ESM2 models and
  ESM-2 embeddings described in the manuscript.
- Exploration of the atlas (searching, browsing, viewing scores) does
  not require an ESM Forge token, because no new embeddings or model
  inference are run client-side.
- The atlas is intended as a convenient starting point for exploring
  residue-level predictions without installing local software.

Typical usage:

1. Open:

       https://kaml.computchem.org/human

2. Search or browse for a protein of interest by UniProtKB accession
   or gene name.
3. Inspect the per-residue KaML-ESM2 predictions. 

The precomputed human proteome-wide atlas integrates three key types of information, which correspond
to sections in the web interface:

# Command-line Inference Interface 
Command-line interface for running KaML-ESM2, KaML-ESMC, and KaML-CBT2 
residue-level predictions on protein sequences using either ESM-2 or ESM-C
embeddings and pre-trained weights.

---

## Repository layout

- kamlCLI.py
  Main command-line interface.

- env/wizard.sh
  Simple installation wizard that creates a Python virtual environment,
  installs dependencies, and downloads pretrained weights from Zenodo.

- env/wts/
  Default location for model weight directories. The CLI expects
  task-specific subdirectories here (i.e. esm2, esmC, CBtree2).

---

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with >= 24GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4090)
- 40 GB disk space
- 128 GB system memory
- Python 3.10 or newer
- POSIX-like environment (Linux / macOS)
- Packages: $(project_root)/env/KaML-ESM_env.txt

You can install these manually:

    pip install -r env/KaML-ESM_env.txt

note: if you do a manual installation, you must add $(project_root)/bin to your PATH variable.

alternatively (recommended): use the provided wizard.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/JanaShenLab/KaML-ESM.git
    cd KaML-ESM

Run the installation wizard:

    bash env/wizard.sh

The wizard:

- creates a virtual environment named "KaML"
- activates it
- upgrades pip
- installs core Python dependencies
- is the place to add commands to download weights from Zenodo into
  env/wts/

To re-activate the environment later:

    source activate

---

## Weights

By default, kamlCLI.py looks for model weights under:

    env/wts/

with task-specific subdirectories (for example):

- env/wts/esm2/acidic
- env/wts/esm2/basic
- env/wts/esmC/acidic
- env/wts/esmC/basic
- env/wts/CBtree2

You can override the root directory for weights with:

    export KAML_WTS_DIR=/path/to/wts

and the CLI will use that directory instead of env/wts/.

---

## Forge token

NOTE: This section ONLY pertains to KaML-ESMC models.

The CLI requires an ESM Forge token to compute ESM-C embeddings.

- To obtain an ESM Forge token see Web-based inference.

Token handling:

1. First run:
   - Provide a token via --forge-token, either as the raw string or a
     path to a file that contains the token.
   - The token is cached to a user-level file (by default:
     ~/.esm_forge_token).

2. Subsequent runs:
   - If --forge-token is omitted, the cached token is used.
   - If no cached token exists, the CLI will prompt for one
     interactively (input is hidden) and then cache it.

You can override the cache location with:

    export KAML_FORGE_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/token_file

---

## Basic usage

Activate the environment:

    source KaML/bin/activate

Run a single sequence:

    python kamlCLI.py \
      --sequence "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY" \
      --id example1 \
      --forge-token /path/to/forge_token.txt

Run multiple sequences from a FASTA file:

    python kamlCLI.py \
      --fasta proteins.fasta \
      --forge-token /path/to/forge_token.txt

If a token has already been cached, you can omit --forge-token and the
CLI will reuse the saved token or prompt for one if needed.

---

## Output

By default, per-residue predictions are printed as a tab-separated
table to standard output.

To write the table to a file:

    python kamlCLI.py \
      --sequence "MQLKPMEINPEMLNKVLSRLGVAGQWRFVDVLGLEEESLGSVPAPACALLLLFPLTAQHENFRKKQIEELKGQEVSPKVYFMKQTIGNSCGTIGLIHAVANNQDKLGFEDGSVLKQFLSETEKMSPEDRAKCFEKNEAIQAAHDAVAQEGQCRVDDKVNFHFILFNNVDGHLYELDGRMPFPVNHGASSEDTLLKDAAKVCREFTEREQGEVRFSAVALCKAA" \
      --id uchl1 \
      --out uchl1.tsv

At the end of the run you will see:

    output written to: results.tsv

The first line of the file is a header:

    Residue_ID    Pred_pKa  Pred_Shift     Error  Conf_pKa
    ...

Each subsequent line corresponds to a residue position. Note: Conf_pKa only present when CBTree2 has been invoked.

---

## Reproducibility

The CLI echoes the full command line used to invoke it immediately
after the splash screen. This makes it straightforward to record and
reproduce runs from logs or publications.
